### **3. Practical Implementation Strategy**
**Phase 1: Core Security Metrics**
- SSL/TLS validation
- Security headers analysis
- Malware/phishing database checks
- Domain reputation lookup

**Phase 2: Add Reputation Signals**
- Domain age analysis
- Historical incident tracking
- Third-party reputation APIs integration

**Phase 3: Content & Compliance**
- Privacy policy detection/analysis
- Contact information validation
- Legal compliance indicators

### **4. Score Interpretation Framework**
I'd recommend these ranges:
- **0.9-1.0**: Highly trusted (banks, major corporations, verified entities)
- **0.7-0.89**: Good trust (legitimate businesses, established sites)
- **0.5-0.69**: Moderate trust (newer sites, some concerns)
- **0.3-0.49**: Low trust (multiple red flags, proceed with caution)
- **0.0-0.29**: Very low trust (malicious, compromised, or highly suspicious)
