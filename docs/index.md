# AiHint Standard

An open standard for signed, verifiable metadata for websites.

## What is AiHint?

AiHint Standard provides a way to add signed, verifiable metadata to websites. This metadata can include information about the site's purpose, ownership, security practices, and more. The signatures ensure that the metadata hasn't been tampered with and comes from a trusted source.
